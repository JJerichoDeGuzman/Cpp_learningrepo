##### Exercise 1 
**Problem** <hr>

> Create a program that asks the user to enter a decimal number, waits for them to input a number, then tells them what half of that number is. The program should produce the following output (assume the user entered 10.0 as input):
	Enter a decimal number: 10.0 Half of that number is: 5.0

**Solution** <hr>


##### Exercise 2

**Problem** <hr>

> Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integers, waits for them to input the numbers, and then displays the sum of the two numbers. The program should produce the following output (assume the user entered 3 and 5 as inputs):
	Enter the first number: 3 Enter the second number: 5 The sum of the numbers is: 8
<hr>


##### Exercise 3 

**Problem** <hr>

>Develop a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer, waits for them to input a number, and then determines if the number is even or odd. The program should produce the following output (assume the user entered 7 as input):
  Enter a positive integer: 7 The number is odd.

**Solution** <hr>


##### Exercise 4

**Problem** <hr>

>  Create a program that prompts the user to enter the radius of a circle, waits for them to input a number, and then calculates and displays the area of the circle. The program should produce the following output (assume the user entered 2.5 as input):
    Enter the radius of the circle: 2.5 The area of the circle is: 19.

**Solution** <hr>

##### Exercise 5

**Problem**
>Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers, waits for them to input the numbers, and then finds and displays the largest number among the three. The program should produce the following output (assume the user entered 10, 7, and 13 as inputs):
  Enter the first number: 10 Enter the second number: 7 Enter the third number: 13 The largest number is: 13
